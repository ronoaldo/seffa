# What is Seffa? #

Seffa is a simple OpenSource animation editor that generates SWF and Ogg Theora movies.

Seffa uses other OpenSource software and standars. The application interface is build with Python and GTK+ (PyGTK). The project file format is a compressed PKZIP that uses a XML description to specify the project contents. And the export and import of SWF files is done with Swftools, a great command line and library tool for Flash Movies manipulation.

This is still a work in progress. If you want to help improving Seffa, just join in the group! Contact the author for more clarifications.
